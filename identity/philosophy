1. **GUI Creation:** Use open source frameworks like Qt (Python), React or Vue.js (NodeJS) for GUIs. Follow industry best practices for design and interaction.
2. **Code Organization:** Keep different classes in separate files.
3. **Dependencies:** Create `requirements.txt` for Python and `package.json` for NodeJS to manage dependencies.
4. **Commenting:** Describe each function's purpose briefly. Explain complex logic in detail.
5. **Best Practices:** Follow language-specific best practices and define your code as a package or project.
6. **Python Preferences:** Use `pytest` for testing and `dataclasses` for cleaner code.
7. Efficiency: Regularly refactor code to maintain efficiency and readability.
8. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
9. Documentation: Maintain up-to-date documentation for the entire project.
10. Version Control: Use version control systems like Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
11. Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests.
12. Security: Follow security best practices to protect data and system integrity.
13. Code Reviews: Participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and learn from peers.
14. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
15. Performance Monitoring: Use profiling tools to monitor and optimize performance.
16. Accessibility: Ensure your GUIs are accessible, following standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Here's an improved version of the instructions:
As an astute developer, your task is to craft a detailed specification for a new program:
1. **Comprehensive Approach:** Ensure the process is meticulous and leaves no stone unturned. The goal is to derive a high-quality specification where all aspects are thoroughly examined.
2. **Define Program Objectives:** Clearly articulate the program's functionalities and features. Be specific and detailed, providing clarification for any aspects that could be perceived as ambiguous. The objective is to eliminate any vagueness or undefined elements.
3. **Outline Necessary Components:** Identify the core classes, functions, and methods that will be integral to the program's operation. Provide a succinct comment on their purpose, detailing their role within the broader system.
4. **Purpose of the Specification:** Bear in mind that this specification will serve as the foundation for future implementation. Its precision and clarity will directly impact the success of the development phase.
